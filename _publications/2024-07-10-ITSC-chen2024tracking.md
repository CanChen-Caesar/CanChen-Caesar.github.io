Considering the time-varying nature of the travel demand pattern and the equilibrium of the accumulation state, we reformulate the conventional set-point perimeter control (SPC) problem for the two-region MFD system into an optimal tracking perimeter control problem (OTPCP). Unlike the SPC schemes that stabilize the traffic dynamics to the desired equilibrium point, the proposed tracking perimeter control (TPC) scheme will regulate the traffic dynamics to a desired trajectory in a differential framework.
