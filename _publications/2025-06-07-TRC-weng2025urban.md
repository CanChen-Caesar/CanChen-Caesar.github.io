In this paper, we explore flow-based traffic modeling for LAAT systems, including the static model of network equilibrium, as well as dynamic models of demand management and air traffic control. The proposed scheme, by coupling dynamic traffic control and demand management, can adjust the desired equilibrium according to changes in demand patterns, thus guaranteeing the feasibility of the set-point control problem with respect to varying demand patterns.
