This paper develops a novel perimeter control-regional toll (PCRT) framework to minimize passenger total travel time spent (PTTS) within urban networks while strategically prioritizing efficient transport modes. A key aspect of this framework is the incorporation of network separation, allowing for dedicated lanes for prioritized vehicles (PVs) in certain regions and mixed traffic operations in others. Comprehensive experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the PCRT framework. The proposed PCRT approach is compared against traditional control strategies such as proportional perimeter control and MPC-based perimeter control without network segregation. Simulation results demonstrate that the PCRT framework achieves a significant improvement in minimizing PTTS and preventing oversaturation in both central and peripheral regions. Moreover, the PCRT framework enhances the mobility of PVs by performing a proper network separation, which takes center stage in the traffic management of multi-region MFD-based urban networks with priorities. Furthermore, the devised event-triggered regional toll strategy incentivizes non-PVs to utilize the PV infrastructure strategically, providing a mechanism for demand management and improved driving experiences.
