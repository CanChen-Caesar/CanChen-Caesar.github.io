In this work, we propose an operational framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance to achieve an elegant improvement in air traffic safety and efficiency. The route guidance mechanism aims to optimize aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance module aims to generate collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in 3D space. To enable large-scale operations, we develop a fast approximation method to solve the optimal path planning problem and employ the velocity obstacle model for collision avoidance.
