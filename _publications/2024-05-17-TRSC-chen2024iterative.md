This paper develops an integrated strategy that couples perimeter control and regional route guidance in the management of MFD systems. The model used for optimization is distinguished from the plant that represents reality due to their differences in structure and the inherent network uncertainty. An iterative adaptive dynamic programming approach is proposed to address the limited data source induced by the model-plant mismatch and circumvent the necessity of exact system knowledge when devising optimal control strategies.
