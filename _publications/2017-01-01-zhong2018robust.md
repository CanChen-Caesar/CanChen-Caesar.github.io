The main objective of this paper is to explore a new robust perimeter control framework for dynamic traffic networks with parameter uncertainty (on the MFD) and exogenous disturbance induced by travel demand. The disturbance in question is in general time-varying and stochastic. Our main contribution focuses on developing a control-Lyapunov function (CLF) based approach to establishing a couple of universal control laws, one is almost smooth and the other is Bang-bang like, for different implementation scenarios. Moreover, it is indicated that the almost smooth control is more suited for road pricing while the Bang-bang like control for signal timing. In sharp contrast to existing methods, in which adjusting extensive design parameters are usually needed, the proposed methods can determine the control in an automatic manner. Both stability and robustness can be substantially observed. As a major consequence, the proposed methods achieve not only global asymptotic stability but also appealing robustness for the closed-loop traffic system.
